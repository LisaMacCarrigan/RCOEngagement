          <h3 class="card-title">Development in My City</h3>
          <p class="card-text mt-5"><strong>Development in Philadelphia is governed by the <a href="http://www.amlegal.com/codes/client/philadelphia_pa/" target="_blank">Philadelphia Zoning Code</a></strong>. The two primary purposes of the Code are 1) to ensure that a building has the appropriate use for its location (e.g., prohibiting a fireworks factory in the middle of a block of homes) and 2) to ensure the design of the building is appropriate in regards to its location (e.g., prohibiting a skyscraper in South Philadelphia).</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>The Zoning Code sets rules for the use and design of buildings, and construction projects outside the Code require a “variance” to move forward</strong>. Developers and property owners need permits in order to do construction. To get the permits, developers and property owners have to submit project plans to the City. The Department of Licenses and Inspections (L&amp;I) reviews the plans. If the plans follow the Code, L&amp;I issues the permits and the developer can build the project “by-right”. If the plans do not follow the zoning code for that piece of land, L&amp;I issues a <strong>refusal</strong> and outlines what part of the Code the plan violates. The developer can either 1) amend the plan to fall within the existing zoning code, or 2) <a href="http://www.phila.gov/li/Pages/Appeals.aspx" target="_blank">appeal the refusal</a> to the <a href="http://planphilly.com/directory/organizations/zoning-board-of-adjustment" target="_blank">Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA)
          </a> and seek a <strong>variance</strong> from the Code. The property owner or developer must get community input about the project through the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/CITYPLANNING/PROJECTREVIEWS/Pages/RegisteredCommunityOrganizations.aspx" target="_blank">Registered Community Organization (RCO)</a> in the property’s neighborhood before the ZBA decides whether or not to grant a variance. Neighbors get to learn about the project that varies from the zoning code, and vote on whether or not to allow the variance. While the ZBA is not required to follow the community input obtained by the RCO, it often influences the ZBA’s decision.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>This matters because there are more zoning variances granted in Philadelphia than in most other cities</strong>. Philadelphia’s neighborhoods are currently undergoing rapid change. One reason for these fast-paced, dramatic changes are the zoning variances being granted to developers. If you want to participate in the way your neighborhood is changing, then it’s important to be aware of, and participate in, zoning meetings at your local Registered Community Organization.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Development in My Neighborhood</h3>
          <p class="card-text mt-5"><strong>When a developer or property owner appeals a refusal to the ZBA, the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/cityplanning/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">City Planning Commission</a> sends notice to all of the Registered Community Organizations (RCOs)</strong> whose boundaries include the location of the project. When there are multiple RCOs for a project, the <a href="http://phlcouncil.com/council-members/" target="_blank">District City Councilperson</a> will appoint a <strong>Coordinating RCO</strong> to facilitate the public meeting process. Upon receiving notice of appeal, the Coordinating RCO consults with the developer or property owner and any other affected RCOs in order to set a public meeting date, time and place to discuss the project. This public meeting must be held within 45 days of the date of appeal and it must be advertised to the public. The ZBA will not hear a developer’s appeal until they receive documentation that the public meeting occurred, or until the developer proves that they made efforts to schedule a public RCO meeting within the 45 day time period, but the meeting did not happen.</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>At the public RCO meeting, the developer presents the proposal and receives community feedback and input</strong>. This is when local residents and business owners get to learn about the zoning variance, voice any concerns, and vote on whether or not they want to approve the variance. Every RCO must provide a written meeting summary to the Zoning Board, the Planning Commission and the District Councilmember.</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>The letter that summarizes the RCO meeting and community input is a critical tool for the ZBA in deciding whether or not to grant a variance</strong>. While the ZBA is not required to follow the recommendations made by the community, the RCO letter often influences the ZBA’s decision.</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>RCOs also play an important role in the zoning process by representing the community in negotiations with the developer regarding changes to the project</strong>. In many cases, the project initially presented by a developer will undergo significant changes based on input and feedback from the community and RCOs.</p>

          <!-- RCOs in My Neighborhood -->
          <h3 class="card-title">Registered Community Organizations in My Neighborhood</h3>
          <p class="card-text mt-5">Registered Community Organizations (RCOs) were created by the City of Philadelphia to gather community input to help the Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA) to decide whether or not to grant case-by-case variances from the Zoning Code to developers and property owners.</p>

          <h4 class="card-title mt-4">What is a Registered Community Organization?</h4>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>The term RCO applies only to those volunteer organizations who have applied for, and received, “registered” status with the city by meeting certain minimum standards to have an official role in the local zoning process</strong>. RCOs cover a certain area of land, called parcels. There are over 200 RCOs in Philadelphia. Some areas are covered by more than one RCO, and other areas have no RCO at all. Political Ward Committees are considered RCO’s, but they are not held to the same standards. <strong>If you live in a neighborhood that only has a Political Ward Committee RCO, then your community would likely benefit from a new RCO that adheres to the full standards</strong>.</p>
          <p class="card-text">The registration standards are designed to ensure that membership of the RCO is <strong>open to the public and is transparent with community engagement regarding zoning issues</strong>.</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>The government standards require that RCOs:</strong></p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Have a statement of purpose that includes land use, zoning, development or preservation</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Have rules or bylaws governing organizational operations</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Identify the geographical boundaries for its jurisdiction (not to exceed 20,000 parcels)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Have a public membership drawn from its geographical boundaries</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Hold elections to select leadership of the organization</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Advertise for and hold regularly scheduled meetings open to the general public</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="card-text mt-4"><strong>This website helps you learn more about your RCO by making their application documents easily accessible.</strong> You can read the RCO’s mission statement, find out who is on the board, learn when and where the regular meetings happen, and see what issues, other than zoning, your RCO cares about in your neighborhood.</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>To find the application documents:</strong></p>

          <h4 class="card-title mt-4">What Else Can RCOs Do For My Neighborhood?</h4>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>In addition to zoning, many RCOs have other committees that work to improve the quality of life in your neighborhood</strong>. These committees often have well-established relationships with different departments in the City of Philadelphia and are an important link between residents and their government officials.</p>
          <p class="card-text"><strong>Some common RCO committees include:</strong></p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span><strong>Clean and Green</strong> committees focus on anti-litter, neighborhood cleanups and beautification projects</span>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span><strong>Public Safety</strong> committees focus on public safety issues including crime, pedestrian and bicycle safety issues</span>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">
              <span><strong>Education</strong> committees provide resources and support to local schools</span>
            </li>

              <span><strong>Economic Development</strong> committees work to attract new businesses and supporting existing local businesses in the neighborhood</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
